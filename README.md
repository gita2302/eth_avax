# RewardsManager Smart Contract

A Solidity-based smart contract for managing a blockchain reward points system.

## Description

RewardsManager is an Ethereum smart contract designed to implement a flexible reward points system. It allows the contract owner to check eligibility for different reward tiers (Premium, Standard, and Basic) and update reward points accordingly. The contract includes security measures such as owner-only functions and event emission for transparency.

Key features include:
- Maintenance of a reward points balance
- Implementation of different reward tiers: Premium, Standard, and Basic
- Restriction of certain functions to the contract owner only
- Event emission when reward points are updated
- Safety checks and error handling

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Ensure you have a development environment set up for Ethereum smart contracts (like Truffle or Hardhat).
2. Clone this repository or copy the contract code into a new Solidity file (.sol) in your project.

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with this contract:

1. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network (local, testnet, or mainnet).
2. The address that deploys the contract becomes the contract owner.
3. Use a web3 library or an Ethereum wallet to interact with the deployed contract.

Example deployment using Truffle:

```
truffle migrate --network rinkeby
```

Example interaction using web3.js:

```javascript
const RewardsManager = artifacts.require("RewardsManager");
const rewardsManager = await RewardsManager.deployed();

// Check for premium reward
await rewardsManager.checkForPremiumReward(95);

// Check current reward points
const points = await rewardsManager.rewardPoints();
console.log("Current reward points:", points.toString());
```

## Help

Common issues and solutions:

- Ensure you're connected to the correct Ethereum network when deploying and interacting with the contract.
- If functions fail, make sure you're calling them from the contract owner's address for owner-only functions.
- Verify that you have sufficient ETH for gas fees when making transactions.

For more help:

```
// You can view the contract's ABI to understand its interface
console.log(JSON.stringify(RewardsManager.abi));
```
